## Problem Statement Analysis & Product Vision

### The Challenge
Building an MVP Leave Management System for a 50-employee startup that empowers HR teams to efficiently manage employee leaves while ensuring transparency and fairness in the process.

### User Personas & Pain Points

**Primary Users:**
1. **HR Administrators** - Need to manage leave requests, maintain employee records, and ensure policy compliance
2. **Employees** - Need to apply for leaves, track their balance, and get quick approvals
3. **Managers** - Need visibility into team availability and streamlined approval workflows

**Key Pain Points Addressed:**
- Manual leave tracking leading to errors and disputes
- Lack of real-time leave balance visibility
- Inefficient approval workflows
- Difficulty in managing team capacity planning
- Compliance issues with leave policies

### Core Features & Business Logic

#### 1. Employee Management
- **Purpose**: Centralized employee database with leave entitlements
- **Key Data**: Name, Email, Department, Joining Date, Leave Balances
- **Business Rules**: 
  - Annual leave allocation based on joining date (pro-rated)
  - Department-specific leave policies
  - Automatic balance updates on leave approval/rejection

#### 2. Leave Application System
- **Purpose**: Streamlined leave request submission with validation
- **Workflow**: Employee submits ‚Üí System validates ‚Üí Manager/HR approves ‚Üí Balance updated
- **Smart Features**: 
  - Conflict detection for overlapping requests
  - Balance validation before submission
  - Calendar integration hints

#### 3. Approval Management
- **Purpose**: Efficient review and decision-making process
- **Features**: 
  - Bulk approval capabilities
  - Approval history tracking
  - Automated notifications

#### 4. Leave Balance Tracking
- **Purpose**: Real-time visibility into available leave credits
- **Analytics**: 
  - Individual balance queries
  - Department-wise utilization reports
  - Predictive balance planning

## Comprehensive Edge Cases Analysis

### Technical Edge Cases
1. **Date Validation Issues**
   - End date before start date
   - Leave applied for past dates
   - Leave applied before joining date
   - Weekend/holiday-only leave requests
   - Invalid date formats (Feb 30, etc.)

2. **Balance Management**
   - Applying for more days than available
   - Negative balance scenarios
   - Partial day leave requests
   - Leave cancellation after approval
   - Mid-year policy changes affecting balances

3. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Multiple leave requests for same period
   - Simultaneous approval/rejection by different HR users
   - Race conditions during balance updates
   - System performance during peak usage

### Business Logic Edge Cases
4. **Employee Lifecycle**
   - Employee leaving mid-year (leave balance settlement)
   - Employee rejoining after resignation
   - Department transfers affecting leave policies
   - Promotion/role changes impacting entitlements

5. **Policy Compliance**
   - Maximum consecutive leave days restrictions
   - Minimum notice period requirements
   - Blackout periods (project deadlines, festivals)
   - Carry-forward vs use-it-or-lose-it policies

6. **Approval Workflow**
   - Manager unavailable during approval period
   - Escalation to senior management
   - Emergency leave applications
   - Medical leave with documentation requirements

### User Experience Edge Cases
7. **Interface & Accessibility**
   - Mobile responsiveness for field employees
   - Offline capability for remote workers
   - Multi-language support for diverse teams
   - Accessibility compliance for differently-abled users

8. **Integration Scenarios**
   - Calendar synchronization failures
   - Email notification delivery issues
   - Backup/disaster recovery scenarios
   - Migration from existing systems

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js (RESTful APIs with PostgreSQL integration)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production-ready with Neon.tech hosting)
- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI v5 (Professional full-screen interface)
- **State Management**: React Context API with useReducer

## System Architecture

### Current MVP Architecture (50 employees)

```
Frontend (React + Vite) ‚Üí API Server (Express.js) ‚Üí Database (SQLite)
```

**Components:**
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI, Context API for state management
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API with comprehensive validation
- **Database**: SQLite with optimized schema and indexes
- **Authentication**: JWT-based (prepared for implementation)

### Scaling Strategy (50 ‚Üí 500 employees)

#### Phase 1: Vertical Scaling (50-150 employees)
- **Database Migration**: SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL for better concurrency
- **Indexing**: Add composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement database connection pooling
- **Caching**: Add Redis for session management and frequent queries

#### Phase 2: Horizontal Scaling (150-500 employees)
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX load balancer with multiple API instances
- **Database Replicas**: Read replicas for reporting and analytics
- **CDN Integration**: Serve static assets via CDN (Cloudflare/AWS)
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, authentication, and request routing

#### Phase 3: Microservices (500+ employees)
- **Service Decomposition**:
  - Employee Service (CRUD operations, profile management)
  - Leave Service (requests, approvals, balance calculations)
  - Notification Service (emails, push notifications, reminders)
  - Reporting Service (analytics, exports, compliance reports)
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ/Redis for asynchronous processing
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event sourcing for audit trails

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Partitioning**: Partition leave_requests by year/department
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing for heavy operations
- **API Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Query Optimization**: Implement query caching and optimization
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting

#### Infrastructure Recommendations
- **Development**: Current setup (local development)
- **Staging**: Docker containers with Docker Compose
- **Production**: Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for high availability
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, ELK stack for logs

2. **Working Days**: Monday-Friday (5-day work week)
3. **Leave Types**: Annual (24 days) and Sick (12 days) per year
4. **Pro-ration**: New joiners get pro-rated annual leave based on joining month
5. **Approval**: Single-level approval (HR or Manager)
6. **Authentication**: Simplified for MVP (will add proper auth in production)

## Future Enhancements
