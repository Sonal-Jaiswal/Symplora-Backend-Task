    "reason": "Invalid date range"
  }'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request with validation error
```

### 3. Insufficient Leave Balance
```bash
# Requesting more days than available
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/leave-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "employee_id": 1,
    "leave_type": "annual",
    "start_date": "2025-02-01",

## Complete Workflow Test

1. **Load Demo Data**: Click "Load Demo Data" button
2. **View Employees**: Navigate to Employees tab, verify 5 employees loaded
3. **Add Employee**: Create new employee with valid data
4. **Submit Leave**: Create leave request for existing employee
5. **Approve Leave**: Approve the pending request
6. **Check Balance**: Verify employee balance decremented
7. **Submit Invalid**: Try submitting leave with past dates (should fail)
8. **Submit Excessive**: Try requesting more days than available (should fail)

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl http://localhost:3001/api/employees &
done
wait

# All requests should complete successfully
```

### Database Consistency
```bash
# Submit multiple leave requests and verify balance calculations
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/leave-requests -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employee_id":1,"leave_type":"annual","start_date":"2025-03-01","end_date":"2025-03-03","reason":"Test 1"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/leave-requests -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employee_id":1,"leave_type":"annual","start_date":"2025-04-01","end_date":"2025-04-03","reason":"Test 2"}'

# Check employee balance remains consistent
curl http://localhost:3001/api/employees/1/leave-balance
```
